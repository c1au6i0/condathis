\arguments{
\item{cmd}{Character. The main command to be executed in the Conda environment.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to the command. These arguments will be passed directly to the command executed in the Conda environment.
File paths should not contain special characters or spaces.}

\item{env_name}{Character. The name of the Conda environment where the tool will be run. Defaults to \code{"condathis-env"}.
If the specified environment does not exist, it will be created automatically using \code{create_env()}.}

\item{method}{Character string. The method to use for running the command. Options are \code{"native"}, \code{"auto"}, \code{"docker"}, or \code{"singularity"}. Defaults to \code{"native"}.
If \code{"auto"} is selected, the function will automatically choose the appropriate method based on the system and available resources.}

\item{container_name}{Character string. The name of the container to be used when running the command via Docker or Singularity. Defaults to \code{"condathis-micromamba-base"}.}

\item{image_name}{Character string. The name of the Docker image to use when the method is \code{"docker"}. Defaults to \code{"luciorq/condathis-micromamba:latest"}.}

\item{mount_paths}{Character vector. Host paths to be mounted in the container. Useful when using Docker or Singularity methods.}

\item{packages}{Character vector. Additional Conda packages to install in the environment before running the command.}

\item{channels}{Character vector. Conda channels to use when installing packages. Defaults to \code{c("bioconda", "conda-forge")}.}

\item{additional_channels}{Character vector. Additional Conda channels to include when installing packages.}

\item{sif_image_path}{Character string. The file path to the Singularity image file (\code{.sif}) to use when the method is \code{"singularity"}.}

\item{gpu_container}{Logical. Whether to enable GPU support in the container. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{verbose}{Character string specifying the verbosity level of the function's output. Acceptable values are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"silent"}: Suppress all output from internal command-line tools. Equivalent to \code{FALSE}.
\item \strong{"cmd"}: Print the internal command(s) passed to the command-line tool.
\item \strong{"output"}: Print the standard output and error from the command-line tool to the screen. Note that the order of the standard output and error lines may not be correct, as standard output is typically buffered. If the standard output and/or error is redirected to a file or they are ignored, they will not be echoed.
\item \strong{"full"}: Print both the internal command(s) (\code{"cmd"}) and their standard output and error (\code{"output"}). Equivalent to \code{TRUE}.
}

Logical values \code{FALSE} and \code{TRUE} are also accepted for backward compatibility but are \emph{soft-deprecated}. Please use \code{"silent"} and \code{"full"} respectively instead.}

\item{error}{Character string. How to handle errors. Options are \code{"cancel"} or \code{"continue"}. Defaults to \code{"cancel"}.}

\item{stdout}{Default: "|" keep stdout to the R object
returned by \code{run()}.
A character string can be used to define a file path to be used as standard output. e.g: "output.txt".}

\item{stderr}{Default: "|" keep stderr to the R object
returned by \code{run()}.
A character string can be used to define a file path to be used as standard error. e.g: "error.txt".}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{list} representing the result of the command execution.
Contains information about the standard output, standard error, and exit status of the command.
}
\description{
This function allows the execution of command-line tools within a specified Conda environment.
It runs the provided command in the designated Conda environment using the Micromamba binaries managed by the \code{condathis} package.
The function supports multiple execution methods, including native execution, Docker containers, and Singularity containers.
}
\details{
The \code{run()} function provides a flexible way to execute command-line tools within Conda environments.
It leverages Micromamba for environment management and supports execution via native methods or containerization technologies like Docker and Singularity.
This is particularly useful for reproducible research and ensuring that specific versions of tools are used.

\examples{
\dontrun{
## Run a simple command in the default Conda environment
run("ls", "-l")

## Run a command in a specific Conda environment
run("python script.py", env_name = "my-conda-env")

## Run a command with additional arguments
run("my-command", "--arg1", "--arg2=value", env_name = "my-conda-env")

## Run a command using Docker
run("python script.py", method = "docker")

## Run a command with GPU support in a container
run("my-gpu-command", gpu_container = TRUE)
